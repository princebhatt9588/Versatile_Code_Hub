## WiFi Password Retriever Program

This is a Python program that retrieves and displays the passwords of WiFi networks that have been previously connected to a Windows computer. It uses the `subprocess` module to interact with the Windows command line utility `netsh` for querying WiFi profiles and their associated passwords.

### Prerequisites

- Python interpreter (3.x recommended)
- Windows operating system

### How it works

1. The program starts by using the `subprocess.check_output()` function to execute the command `netsh wlan show profiles`. This command retrieves a list of all WiFi profiles that have been connected to the computer.

2. The output of the command is decoded from bytes to a string using UTF-8 encoding and then split into lines.

3. The program iterates through the lines of output, searching for lines containing the text "All User Profile". It extracts the name of each WiFi profile and stores it in the `profiles` list.

4. For each WiFi profile name in the `profiles` list, the program again uses `subprocess.check_output()` to execute the command `netsh wlan show profile <profile_name> key=clear`. This command retrieves detailed information about the specified WiFi profile, including the password (key content).

5. The output of the command is similarly decoded and split into lines.

6. The program searches through the lines of output, looking for the line containing "Key Content". It then extracts the password from that line and stores it in the `results` list.

7. The program attempts to print the WiFi profile name and its associated password. If there is an issue retrieving the password (for example, if the WiFi network has no password), an empty string is printed.

8. After all profiles have been processed, the program waits for user input, effectively keeping the console window open until the user presses Enter.

### Usage

1. Save the provided code in a Python file (e.g., `wifi_password_retriever.py`).

2. Open a command prompt or terminal.

3. Navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.

4. Run the program by executing the following command:
   ```
   python wifi_password_retriever.py
   ```

### Example Output

```
Network1                       |  Password123
Network2                       |  MySecretPass
Network3                       |  
```

In this example, the program has retrieved and displayed the passwords for three WiFi networks. "Network1" and "Network2" have passwords, while "Network3" does not have a password associated.

Remember that this program retrieves passwords for WiFi networks that the computer has previously connected to. It might not work for networks that were never connected to the computer or networks that have been forgotten. Use this program responsibly and only on systems you have permission to access.
