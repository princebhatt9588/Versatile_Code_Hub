# Password Generator Program

This is a simple Python program that generates random passwords based on user input. It ensures that the generated password meets certain criteria, such as a minimum length and inclusion of various character types.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download or copy the provided code into a `.py` file, such as `password_generator.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `password_generator.py` file is located.
4. Run the program by executing the following command:

   ```
   python password_generator.py
   ```

5. Follow the prompts to specify the desired length of the password.

## Program Explanation

The program consists of several functions and a main execution block. Here's a breakdown of each component:

### `getPasswordLength()`

This function is responsible for taking user input to determine the desired password length. The user is prompted to enter a length, and the function returns the entered value.

### `getCharacters()`

This function defines the character sets that can be used to generate the password. It includes lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation symbols. All these character sets are concatenated into the `all_characters` variable.

### `generatePassword(all_characters, password_length)`

This function generates the password by randomly selecting characters from the `all_characters` string. The `random.sample()` function is used to ensure that the characters are chosen without replacement, so each character appears only once in the password.

### `main()`

The main function is where the program execution starts. It displays a welcome message and prompts the user to input the desired password length. If the input is not a valid integer, an error message is shown. The program then repeatedly asks for the password length until a valid value is provided. Once the desired length is obtained, the program proceeds to generate a password and displays it along with a thank you message.

## Sample Output

```

| Welcome to this Password Generator |
-------------------------------------

how long do you want your password to be (minimum of 8 number)12
Your password must have at least 8 characters
Enter the length of password: 12

Your password is: r%3Kp@sNzG6y

## Note

This program serves as a simple password generator and doesn't implement advanced security measures. For stronger and more secure password generation, it's recommended to use built-in password managers or libraries specifically designed for secure password creation.
