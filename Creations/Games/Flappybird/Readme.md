# Flappy Bird Browser Game

This is a simple implementation of the Flappy Bird game using Python and the Pygame library.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and the Pygame library installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flappy-bird-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd flappy-bird-game
   ```

3. Install the required libraries (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

4. Add your game assets to the appropriate folders:
   - Background image: `<path_to_your_assets>/background-night.png`
   - Floor image: `<path_to_your_assets>/base.png`
   - Bird images: `<path_to_your_assets>/bluebird.png`, `bluebird-midflap.png`, `bluebird-upflap.png`
   - Pipe image: `<path_to_your_assets>/pipe-green.png`
   - Game over image: `<path_to_your_assets>/message.png`
   - Sound files: `<path_to_your_assets>/sfx_wing.wav`, `sfx_hit.wav`, `sfx_point.wav`

## Usage

1. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python flappy_bird.py
   ```

2. Control the bird by pressing the `SPACE` key to make it flap and avoid collision with pipes.

3. The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or touches the top/bottom of the screen. You can restart the game by pressing the `SPACE` key after it's over.
